const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What databases are supported?",
    a: "Any database supported by Prisma — PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, CockroachDB, and more. A Drizzle adapter is on the roadmap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it work with frameworks other than Next.js?",
    a: "The widget is framework-agnostic — it works with React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, or vanilla JavaScript. The CLI currently scaffolds Next.js API routes, but the adapter works with any server that handles standard Request/Response.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when the page layout changes?",
    a: "Annotations use multi-selector anchoring — CSS selectors, XPath, text snippets, and structural fingerprints. If one selector breaks, the system falls back to the next. Positions are stored as percentages relative to the anchor element, so they adapt to responsive layouts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a dashboard to view feedback?",
    a: "A dashboard UI is on the roadmap. Currently, feedback is accessible via the widget panel and the API. You can query, filter, and manage feedback programmatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "How big is the widget bundle?",
    a: "The widget is under 20 kB gzipped. It loads asynchronously and never blocks your page rendering.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it GDPR compliant?",
    a: "Fully. Since CCM Feedback is self-hosted, all data stays on your infrastructure. No data is ever sent to third-party servers. You control storage, retention, and deletion.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I customize the widget appearance?",
    a: "Yes — accent color, position (bottom-right or bottom-left), theme (light, dark, auto), and locale (English, French). Full event system for custom integrations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to create an account?",
    a: "No. CCM Feedback is an npm package you install and configure. No account, no API key, no signup. It runs entirely on your infrastructure.",
  },
